## General info
I am building this project as an off platform assignment for my Codecademy - Full Stack Engineer course. I am doing it with the purpose of gaining experience with javaScript, README.md file, Git and Visual Studio Code.


## Technologies
javaScript ES6

## Setup
In your terminal, go to the repo directory and run node jokegen.js

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Randomly generates a joke from an array of 10 one-liner style jokes.
* Code is scalable so that as jokes are added to the array, they will automatically be inlcuded in the range of the random joke generator.

To-do list:
* Increase amount of jokes
## Status
Project is: _in progress_.

## Inspiration
A 'Message Generator' app was sugegsted by Codecademy. I have chosen to make this a random joke generator instead.
